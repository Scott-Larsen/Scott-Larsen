### 🐍 Hello World 🐍

Hi 👋, I’m Scott, a Python developer looking for my first role.  I'm currently in Pennsylvania but willing to relocate anywhere to make that happen.  I have worked in multiple domains in Python - web scraping, flask apps, API consumption - and am particularly interested in computer vision and projects using OpenCV to manipulate and learn from images and videos.
